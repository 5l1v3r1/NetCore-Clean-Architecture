# The Domain Layer

This project contains all entities, enums, types and logic specific to the domain and not related to the application or persistence layer.

## Domain Classes

The classes represented here are a result of collaboration with the non-technical domain experts on the project. Any application models will likely be trasformed from or to the domain models represented in this project in order to better represent the real world model this software strives to represent.

## Model Transformations

Model transformations are facilitated through the AutoMapper Nuget Package

    dotnet add package AutoMapper
